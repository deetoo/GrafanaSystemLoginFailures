# Contributions are welcome!

## Quick guide

* Fork the repo.
* Checkout the branch you want to make changes on:
* Master if you make changes to the code that are not backward compatible.
* Default branch when adding new features.
* Branch before the default if you are fixing a bug for an existing feature (or the default/master branch if the feature was introduced in that version).
* Make changes.

## Opening a pull request

You can do some things to increase the chance that your pull request is accepted the first time:

* Submit one pull request per fix or feature.
* If your changes are not up to date - rebase your branch on the parent branch.
* Follow the conventions used in the project.
* Remember about tests and documentation.
* Don't bump version.
